## Overiview of International Business through the Lens of Culture Model of National Culture Differences

A significant achievement for any organisation in the days of yesteryear would be to conquer their particular territory, be it their town, city or state. The person who conquered the country will be the King of Kings. But in this fast-paced, globalised and dynamic 21st century in which we live, only with organisations expanding internationally is it possible to achieve gigantic magnitudes.
Naturally, the first aspect that pops into our mind when we think of international expansion is the financial aspect of it, and there's nothing wrong with that. If history teaches us something, though, it is that what looks good on paper does not translate into reality in the same way. The initial entry of Kellogg into India, or even the KFCs for that matter, might have made excellent financial sense. Unfortunately, the community was the one shaky foundation that took these willing foreign expansions to the surface.


Knowing the culture of the different countries in which they already work, as well as the ones they are looking to join, becomes a matter of supreme importance for every foreign company to succeed. With this in mind, a much-used structure for understanding cross-cultural differences, known as the Model of National Cultural Differences, was designed by Fons Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner.


Over more than ten years, Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner developed this model. Their research included more than 40 countries across the globe and had more than 40,000 managers. Today, the model is used extensively in international business management, based on seven distinct aspects of national cultural differences.


## Universalism vs Particularism

Individuals place a high significance on laws, rules, qualities, and commitments in nations that rank high on universalism. As per these principles, they interact with other individuals, and while relationships are essential, rules precede them. Meetings are represented by level-headed, competent discussions with people displaying a disposition to "let's get down to business" Where particularism is high, however, people acknowledge that each situation, and each relationship, directs their responses to the position. Given what is going on at the time, and who is included, their response to a situation may change. During such meetings, someone from a universalist culture would be better off not excusing personal meanderings as extraneous matters or superficial chitchat.
Some examples of Universalist cultures are countries such as the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland.
Countries like China, Latin America, Russia are the typical examples of Particulitic cultures.


## INDIVIDUALISM VS COMMUNITARIANISM

Individuals have trust in individual freedom and achievement in nations with high individualism. They acknowledge that you are deciding on your own decisions and that you should take care of yourself. In countries with community highlights, people assume that the group is a higher priority than the individual is. The group offers assistance and security and demands devotion in return. Organisations would therefore have to understand what people are used to in a particular culture, and thus decide the way forward.
The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom of Scandinavia, New Zealand, Australia and Switzerland are some examples of individualistic countries.
Latin-America, Africa and Japan are examples of communitarian cultures.


## Neutral vs Emotional

Individuals have made an extraordinary attempt to control their feelings in a neutral culture. Reason affects their operations more than their emotions and people try not to demonstrate what they think or how they feel. In emotional societies, on the other hand, people tend to find ways to communicate their emotions, sometimes even immediately. It's accepted and encouraged to show emotions in these societies. Organisations will then have to consider what people are used to in a particular community and therefore determine the way forward.
The U.K., Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, and Germany are typical neutral cultures.
Typical emotional cultures include Italy, Spain, France, and Latin American countries.


## Specific vs Diffuse

Individuals do not mix their personal and professional lives in specific cultures. They subsequently agree that relationships do not have a massive impact on the way they work, and they acknowledge that individuals can cooperate without having a decent relationship, while excellent relationships are substantial. Then again, individuals see an overlap in their work and individual lives in diffuse cultures. They recognise that great connections are essential to achieving business goals and that their relationships with others will be the same, regardless of whether they are grinding away at work or socially meeting them. Individuals invest with colleagues and customers in energy outside of work hours.
Specific cultures typically include the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, and the Netherlands.
Argentina, Spain, Russia, India and China are typical diffuse cultures.


## Sequential vs Synchronic

Individuals prefer functions to occur in a well-defined order in cultures with a sequential characteristic. They're positioning on punctuality, planning and being on time a high premium. "time is money," is in this culture, and people do not prefer when their timetable is broken. Nevertheless, in cultures with synchronic characteristics, people see the past,
Present and future as periods that are intertwined. We often work on multiple businesses at once and see plans and responsibilities as an adaptable aspect of life.
Typical sequential-time cultures include Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Japan, Argentina, and Mexico comprise traditional synchronous-time cultures.


## Achievement vs Ascription

Individuals accept that you are what you accomplish in success-driven societies, and they base your value on it.
Properly. Properly. These cultures, regardless of who you are, place emphasis on efficiency. In ascription-driven cultures, at the opposite end of the continuum, people agree that you should
For what your identity is be esteemed. In these societies, authority, title, and status matter, and these functions define actions.
Distinctive cultures of achievement include the U.S., Canada, Scandinavia, and Australia.
Distinctive cultures of Ascription include France, Japan, Italy, and Saudi Arabia.


## Internal vs External Control

Individuals agree that they can manipulate nature or their present circumstances to achieve goals in countries with an inner locus of control. It affects how they interact in societies and organisations. But people believe that their lives are essentially governed by circumstance and the world in which they are in countries with an outer locus of influence. Thus it is likely that individuals prefer to avoid confrontation in such cultures. Israel, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. are traditional internal-direction cultures.
China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia comprise common outer-direction cultures.


The Cultural Aspects theory of Geert Hofstede also attempts to describe the culture in the same way as this model. Initially, this model included four facets of culture, to which two additional distinctions were added later:

Power Distance Index
Individualism vs Collectivism
Uncertainty Avoidance
Masculinity vs Femininity
Long term vs Short term orientation and Indulgence vs Restraint

Although there are some distinctions between the two models, they largely describe the same kind of cultural distinctions that exist.
