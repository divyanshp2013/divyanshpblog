The premise of social entrepreneurship that has transcended as years have gone by is that it is a medium by which local solutions to local community issues can find a voice to be amplified. But we realised as civilisation evolved that this idea of "Problem -> Solution = Eureka!" Not how social entrepreneurship operates.


I found that it was much more difficult for social entrepreneurship than what we see on a surface level. This definition is grossly misunderstood: even those who regard themselves as social entrepreneurs do not recognise the meaning it has. A broad spectrum of thought exists. On the one hand, when individuals think of social entrepreneurship, they envision small micro-scale companies run by local communities to solve an issue. For instance, imagine a rural MP farmer who buys an extra cow to increase his livelihood. Then, on the other hand, we have individuals who think about big international professional organisations that are joining these communities and bringing about change. And while this thinking provides us with a context in which we can think about social entrepreneurship, I believe that what is wrong with the very sense of this notion is this kind of thinking. As a new type of charity, some contemporary theorists look at social entrepreneurship. We think of it as a charity for the 21st century. As a consequence, most social enterprises are financed through grants, philanthropic money, etc. But we know that what this kind of 'philanthropic thought' does from research and practise is that it only perpetuates this vicious cycle that continues to generate dependence.


So you may be asking yourself, what should we do?
We have an opportunity to use social entrepreneurship as a means of changing the world's conditions by discovering and inspiring local grassroots movements. Local solutions to local difficulties.
It was Germans who solved some of Germany's most pressing problems. Likewise, the most pressing issues in India will be solved by Indians. But not everyone can be a leader, a problem solver, so we need to find and identify talented individuals with the abilities that can leave their sheltered communities. We need them to dream of big, bold ideas once we find these people, to revolutionise the ecosystem around them and scale these ideas into an even larger society to make it sustainable. They say they are closest to the solution to those closest to the problem, but not everyone facing a problem is equipped to find a solution. Let us identify the local people who have a solution to their questions and let us give them the support they need to pull their communities on a path to achievement. Let us reconsider social entrepreneurship.
