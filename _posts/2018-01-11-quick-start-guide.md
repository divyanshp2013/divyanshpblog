The journey of Walter White resembles that of an entrepreneur. He finds particular problems and inconveniences along his route for which there is no remedy given by traditional means. He starts innovating and improvising to conquer this barrier, which leads to the development of a new product. This high-quality methamphetamine product will fill the demand gap. He goes on to raise seed money as his next move and makes some local investments. He makes use of regional equipment to start his company because of the lack of access to any high-end fancy equipment.


With a small team (Jesse Pinkman), the job begins, and he is also actively involved in the manufacturing process. White works to build value for his brand and shows how his brand is different and better than what is available on the market. The pre-existing players, challenged by a new participant, attempt to exploit him, but he understands his product's stunning individuality and thus refuses to back off. He employs a lawyer when trouble comes knocking, which outlines the legal element that occurs sooner or later in the career of any entrepreneur.


He makes mistakes, as any person does, but by growing his company, he also learns from them and tries to turn his situation around. His increasing popularity, however, attracts the industry's more influential players who attempt to arm him strongly. His business is taking a big hit as a result of their assaults, leaving him unable to do something. He tries to save the original squad, however, and effectively avoids many crises. He rewards the team for their loyalty, a common thing seen in new business ventures. It makes him the entrepreneur of textbooks.
